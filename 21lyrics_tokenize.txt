I ponder of something greatMy lungs will fill and then deflateThey fill with fire , exhale desireI know it 's dire my time todayI have these thoughts , so often I oughtTo replace that slot with what I once bought'Cause somebody stole my car radioAnd now I just sit in silenceSometimes quiet is violentI find it hard to hide itMy pride is no longer insideIt 's on my sleeveMy skin will scream reminding me ofWho I killed inside my dreamI hate this car that I 'm drivingThere 's no hiding for meI 'm forced to deal with what I feelThere is no distraction to mask what is realI could pull the steering wheelI have these thoughts , so often I oughtTo replace that slot with what I once bought'Cause somebody stole my car radioAnd now I just sit in silenceI ponder of something terrifying'Cause this time there 's no sound to hide behindI find over the course of our human existenceOne thing consists of consistenceAnd it 's that we 're all battling fearOh dear , I do n't know if we know why we 're hereOh my , too deep , please stop thinkingI liked it better when my car had soundThere are things we can doBut from the things that work there are only twoAnd from the two that we choose to doPeace will win and fear will loseIt is faith and there 's sleepWe need to pick one please becauseFaith is to be awakeAnd to be awake is for us to thinkAnd for us to think is to be aliveAnd I will try with every rhymeTo come across like I am dyingTo let you know you need to try to thinkI have these thoughts , so often I oughtTo replace that slot with what I once bought'Cause somebody stole my car radioAnd now I just sit in silenceAnd now I just sit in silenceAnd now I just sitAnd now I just sit in silenceAnd now I just sit in silenceAnd now I just sit in silenceAnd now I just sitI ponder of something greatMy lungs will fill and then deflateThey fill with fire , exhale desireI know it 's dire my time todayI have these thoughts , so often I oughtTo replace that slot with what I once bought'Cause somebody stole my car radioAnd now I just sit in silenceI know what you think in the morningWhen the sun shines on the groundAnd shows what you have doneIt shows where your mind has

will range from up , down , and sidewaysThank God it 's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays'Cause Sundays are my suicide daysI do n't know why they always seem so dismalThunderstorms , clouds , snow and a slight drizzleWhether it 's the weather or the ledges by my bedSometimes death seems better than the migraine in my headLet it be said what the headache representsIt 's me defending in suspenseIt 's me suspended in a defenseless testBeing tested by a ruthless examinerThat 's represented best by my depressing thoughtsI do not have writer 's block my writer just hates the clockIt will not let me sleep I guess I 'll sleep when I 'm deadAnd sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my headAm I the only one I knowWaging my wars behind my face and above my throatShadows will scream that I 'm aloneBut I know , we 've made it this far , kidYeah yeah yeahI am not as fine as I seemPardon , me for yelling and telling you green gardensAre not what 's growing in my psyche , it 's a different meA difficult beast feasting on burnt down treesFreeze frame , please let me paint a mental picture portraitSomething you wo n't forget , it 's all about my foreheadAnd how it is a door that hold 's back contentsThat makes Pandora 's box contents look non-violentBehind my eyelids are islands of violenceMy mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could findI did not know it was such a violent islandFull of tidal waves , suicidal crazed lionsThey 're trying to eat me , blood running down their chinAnd I know that I can fight , or I can let the lion winI begin to assemble what weapons I can find'Cause sometimes to stay alive you got ta kill your mindAm I the only one I knowWaging my wars behind my face and above my throatShadows will scream that I 'm aloneBut I know , we 've made it this far , kidAnd I will say that we should take a day to break awayFrom all the pain our brain has made , the game is not played aloneAnd I will say that we should take a moment and hold itAnd keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertoneAnd I will say that we should take a day to break awayFrom all the pain our brain has made , the game is not played aloneAnd I will say that we should take a moment and hold itAnd keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertoneAm I the only one I knowWaging my wars behind my face and
