ï » ¿I 've given up , I 'm sick of feelingIs there nothing you can say ?Take this all away , I 'm suffocatingTell me what the fuck is wrong with meWhen my time comes , forget the wrong that I 've doneHelp me leave behind some , reasons to be missedDo n't resent me , and when you 're feeling emptyKeep me in your memory , leave out all the restLeave out all the restI ca n't be who you areI ca n't be who you areAnd the sun will set for youThe sun will set for youAnd the shadow of the day will embrace the world in greyAnd the sun will set for youI run 'til the silence splits me openI run 'til it puts me underground'Til I have no breathAnd no roads left but oneNo roads left but oneI do n't know what 's worth fighting forOr why I have to screamBut now I have some clarityTo show you what I meanI do n't know how I got this wayI 'll never be alrightSo , I 'm breaking the habitI 'm breaking the habitIâ€™m breaking the habit tonightI ca n't feel the way I did , beforeDo n't turn your back on me , I wo n't be ignoredTime wo n't heal this damage , anymoreDo n't turn your back on me , I wo n't be ignoredIt 's easier to runReplacing this pain with something numbIt 's so much easier to goThan face all this pain here all aloneI 've become so numb , I ca n't feel you thereBecome so tired , so much more awareI 'm becoming this , all I want to doIs be more like me and be less like you !I know what it takes to move onI know how it feels to lieAll I want to do is trade this life for something newHolding on to what I have n't gotI know what it takes to move onI know how it feels to lieAll I want to do is trade this life for something newHolding on to what I have n't got( When this began )I had nothing to sayAnd I 'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me( I was confused )And I let it all out to findThat I 'm not the only person with these things in mind( Inside of me )But all the vacancy the words revealedIs the only real thing that I 've got left to feel( Nothing to lose )Just stuck , hollow and aloneAnd the fault is my own , and the fault is my ownI wan na heal , I wan na feel what I thought was never realI wan na let go of the pain I 've felt so long( Erase all the pain 'til it 's gone )I wan na heal , I wan na feel like I 'm close to something realI wan na find something I 've wanted all alongSomewhere I belongAnd I 've got nothing to sayI ca n't believe I did n't fall right down on my face( I was confused )Looking everywhere only to findThat it 's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind( So what am I ? )What do I have but negativity'Cause I ca n't justify the way , everyone is looking at me( Nothing to lose )Nothing to gain , hollow and aloneAnd the fault is my own , and the fault is my ownI will never know myself until I do this on my ownAnd I will never feel anything else , until my wounds are healedI will never be anything 'til I break away from meI will break away , I 'll find myself todayI wan na heal , I wan na feel what I thought was never realI wan na let go of the pain I 've felt so long( Erase all the pain 'til it 's gone )I wan na heal , I wan na feel like I 'm close to something realI wan na find something I 've wanted all alongSomewhere I belongI kept everything insideAnd even though I tried , it all fell apartWhat it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time whenI tried so hard and got so farBut in the end , it does n't even matterI had to fall to lose it allBut in the end , it does n't even matterOne thing , I do n't know whyIt does n't even matter how hard you tryKeep that in mindI designed this rhyme to remind myself how I tried so hardIn spite of the way you were mocking meActing like I was part of your propertyRemembering all the times you fought with meI 'm surprised it got so farI watch how the moon sits in the sky of a dark nightShining with the light from the sunBut the sun does n't give the light to the moon assuming ,The moon 's gon na owe it oneIt makes me think of the how you act me ,You do favors then rapidly ,You just turn around and start asking me ,About things that you want back from meI 'm sick of the tensionSick of the hungerSick of you acting like I owe you thisFind another place to feed your greedWhile I find a place to restI wan na be in another placeI hate when you say you do n't understand( You 'll see it 's not meant to be )I wan na be in the energyNot with the enemyA place for my headMaybe some day I 'll be just like you and ,Step on people like you doRun away all the people I thought I knewI remember back then who you wereYou used to be calm used to be strongUsed to be generous but you should 've knownThat you wear out your welcomeNot to see how quiet it is all aloneI 'm so sick of the tensionSick of the hungerSick of you acting like I owe you thisFind another place to feed your greedWhile I find a place to restI 'm so sick of the tensionSick of the hungerSick of you acting like I owe you thisFind another place to feed your greedWhile I find a place to restI wan na be in another placeI hate when you say you do n't understand( You 'll see it 's not meant to be )I wan na be in the energyNot with the enemyA place for my headYou try to take the best of me , go awayYou try to take the best of me , go awayYou try to take the best of me , go awayYou try to take the best of me , go away !With Blackbirds following meI 'm digging out my graveThey close in , swallowing meThe pain , it comes in wavesI 'm getting back what I gaveI sweat through the sheet as daylight fadesAs I waste awayIt traps me inside mistakes I 've madeThat 's the price I payWaking in sweat againAnother day 's been laid to waste , in my disgraceStuck in my head againFeels like I 'll never leave this place , there 's no escapeI 'm my own worst enemyI do n't know what to takeThought I was focused but I 'm scared , I 'm not preparedI hyperventilateLooking for help somehow , somewhere and no one caresI 'm my own worst enemyGod !Put me out of my misery !Put me out of my misery !Put me out of myPut me out of my fucking misery !I dreamed I was missing , you were so scaredBut no one would listen 'cause no one else caredAfter my dreaming , I woke with this fearWhat am I leaving when I 'm done here ?Do n't be afraid , I 've taken my beatingI 've shared what I madeI 'm strong on the surface , not all the way throughI 've never been perfect but neither have youForgetting all the hurt insideYou 've learned to hide so wellPretending someone elseCan come and save me from myselfI ca n't be who you areForgetting all the hurt insideYou 've learned to hide so wellPretending someone elseCan come and save me from myselfI close both locks below the windowI close both blinds and turn awaySometimes solutions are n't so simpleSometimes goodbye 's the only wayIn cards and flowers on your windowYour friends all plead for you to staySometimes beginnings are n't so simpleSometimes goodbye 's the only wayStanding alone with no directionHow did I fall so far behind ?Why am I searching for perfectionKnowing it 's something I wo n't find ?When did I lose my sense of purpose ?Can I regain what 's lost inside ?Why do I feel like I deserve this ?Why does my pain look like my pride ?Memories consume , like opening the woundI 'm picking me apart againYou all assume I 'm safe here in my roomUnless I try to start againClutching my cure , I tightly lock the doorI try to catch my breath againI hurt much more than anytime , beforeI had no options left againI 'll paint it on the walls'Cause I 'm the one at faultI 'll never fight , againAnd this is how it endsI am a little bit of lonelinessA little bit of disregardHandful of complaints , but I ca n't help the factThat everyone can see these scarsI am what I want you to wantWhat I want you to feelBut , it 's like no matter what I doI ca n't convince you to just believe this is realSo , I let go , watching youTurn your back like you always doFace away and pretend that I 'm notBut , I 'll be here 'cause you 're all that I gotI am a little bit insecureA little unconfident'Cause you do n't understand , I do what I canBut sometimes , I do n't make senseI am what you never wan na sayBut , I 've never had a doubtIt 's like no matter what I do
